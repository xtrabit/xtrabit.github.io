        <h2>Hi, <nobr>I'm Alexei</nobr></h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;I am a software engineer with focus on React-Redux and Django-Python,
          and experience in Node and C.
          I enjoy challenging problems and always
          on look out for new tools and methods that would help me find solutions.
          I strive to understand connections and flow for I believe that those
          are key to managing complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;I love to develop with a team and always ready to support the best idea.
          I love to work in an open and friendly environment where ideas can grow into great results.
          I explore because I love to learn, but I also enjoy sharing my discoveries and
          knowledge with my teammates. We fuel each others growth, but plainly its a lot more fun to
          work together.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;I care deeply about products I create, and enjoy refining details, but
          in the time of need, I switch to <strong>get-it-done</strong> attitude, and
          focus on the essential. When creativity runs low, I go camping with my friends,
          or just shoot a bow in a park. Taking apart an old printer would always lift my spirit.
